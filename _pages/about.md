I am a Finance Ph.D. Candidate at the Jones Graduate School of Business, Rice University.  Prior to joining the Jones School, I obtained my B.Sc. from Sharif University of Technology in 2014, and M.Sc. from Rice University in 2017, both in Elecrical Engineering. My research interests include investments, alternative data, disclosures, and intermediary asset pricing. In my [job market paper](assets/pdf/jmp.pdf), I assess the value of investment advisers' tweets for predicting stock returns.

I will be available for interviews in 2022-2023 job market season. You can contact me at [smkazempour@rice.edu](mailto:smkazempour@rice.edu).
