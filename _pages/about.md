I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Jones Graduate School of Business, Rice University. I am available for interviews at AFA 2023. I obtained my masters degree at Elecrical Engineering from Rice University in 2017. Prior to that, I achieved my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology in 2014. My research interest are in empirical asset pricing, alternative data, and disclosures.
