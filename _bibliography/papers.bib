  title={Disseminating Information on Twitter: Evidence from Investment Advisers},
  author={Kazempour, Seyed Mohammad},
  journal={Job Market Paper},
  year={2022},
  abstract={I show that investment advisers disseminate valuable information about stocks on their Twitter accounts. A one standard deviation increase in sentiment predicts 12 bps abnormal returns over the next week. Advisers’ tweets interpret public news, especially analyst revisions and earnings announcements, and also disclose novel information. Advisers offering financial planning services post more informative tweets. Moreover, retail investors trade in the direction of tweets over the following week.},
